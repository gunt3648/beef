            <p>This post shows an interesting location that's supported your reason to travel to Bangkok Thailand.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The history of the city of Bangkok, in Thailand, dates at least to the earlyâ€“15th century, when it was under the rule of Ayutthaya. Due to its strategic location near the mouth of the Chao Phraya River,
               the town gradually increased in importance, and after the fall of Ayutthaya King Taksin established his new capital of Thonburi there, on the river's west bank. King Phutthayotfa Chulalok, 
              who succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank in 1782, to which the city dates its foundation under its current Thai name, "Krung Thep Maha Nakhon". Bangkok has since undergone tremendous changes, growing rapidly, 
              especially in the second half of the 20th century, to become the primate city of Thailand.</p>
            <h2>Ayutthaya </h2>
            <p>Founded c. 1350, Ayutthaya became the second Siamese capital after Sukhothai. It was destroyed by the Burmese in the 18th century. Its remains, characterized by the prang (reliquary towers) and gigantic monasteries, give an idea of its past splendour.</p>
            <h3>Ayutthaya Tips</h3>
            <p>Ayutthaya is an island at the confluence of three rivers: the Chao Phraya River, the Lopburi River and the Pa Sak River. As the train station is at the east side off the island, most visitors will need to cross the river by ferry boat. Navigating your way around the island is not particularly hard: U Thong Rd is a ring road that circumscribes the island completely. Most temple ruins can be found at the northwest of the island, while accommodation and night life is clustered around the northeast. As non-Siamese peoples were not allowed to live inside the city walls, things foreign are found off the island.</p>
